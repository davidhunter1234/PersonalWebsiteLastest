                1. Bike Speedometer & Odometer<br><br>

                <div style="font-size: 1.6vw; color:rgb(223, 223, 223);width:70vw;line-height:2vw;">
                "Initially a project to feed my biking hobby but introduced me into several new and valuable experiences. It was my first encounter with an arduino and its fascinating selection of components to choose from. I fiddled with its coding language which was intuitive and seamlessly tied together the components. “Is a breadboard some kind of food?”, I thought. That was another first for me and I think that they are quite handy. 
                I am pleasantly pleased with how MACH001 came out to be and I hope this is just the beginning of many projects to come. Next time, I want to integrate soldering for a strong connection and 3D printing for a robust and aesthetic housing for the components."</div>

                2. DC Motor Control with Pulse Width Modulation<br><br>

                <div style="font-size: 1.6vw; color:rgb(255, 255, 255);width:70vw;line-height:2vw;">
                    "Sticking to my theme of motion, transportation, power, I chose to learn about DC motors. I was able to control the power of a DC motor through PWN signals but I wasn’t able to implement the LED system to represent the power levels that I planned. I learned about the KIM-1, the 6502 that serves as its brain, address, memory, databus, and I/O ports. I learned assembly language to write the PWM code, involving duty cycles, registers, delays, loading, branching, etc. I learned about MOSFETS and diodes. What I want to do next is learn more about the internals of a computer and instructions I can give it to do cooler operations.
